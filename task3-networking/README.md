# Task 3 - Networking Basics for DevOps

## 📋 What I Did
✅ Analyzed system IP configuration using ip a and ifconfig  
✅ Tested connectivity with ping to public servers  
✅ Inspected open ports and services using netstat/ss  
✅ Performed DNS resolution with nslookup and dig  
✅ Traced network paths using traceroute  
✅ Documented network analysis findings  
✅ Answered networking interview questions
